Swiftclaw is a project that I have been working on since April 2016. After working with Professor Kyle Mandli of Columbia University's Department of Applied Mathematics & Applied Physics, we have been able to produce the beginnings of this program.

Swiftclaw is a collection of Riemann solvers that work together to simulate coastal hazards by solving a solution of partial differential equations. Given a function and input data, swiftclaw produces numerical data that can be graphically presented, using robust solvers specific to each type of simulation.
